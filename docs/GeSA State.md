## Current state

There is a basic version implemented in Swift â€”
[MicroGene](https://github.com/morpheby/MicroGene). It lacks some of the
advertised features, but it provides the necessary foundation to
implement software based on Genetic System Architecture. And, most
importantly, I use it to develop fully-featured GeSA right now.

Also, it would be awesome to have later:

  - GeSA-based language
  - GeSA compartment and data ACLs with Gene trust features
  - GeSA bindings or reimplementations for other languages
  - Better matching algorithms
  - Fully-featured MBEs (probably as part of the language)
  - Gene-packs as libraries
  - GeSA debugger
  - GeSA IDE with data visualization and Gene overview
  - GeSA-based OS with apps as Gene-packs
  - Hardware-based gene-packs

Some already planned changes to make

  - Internalize Genes and theirs execution into the system itself.
    
    The intention of this feature is to make Genes that are in a state
    before executing and just after matching be internal to the storage
    and bindable to. They should also have controls over their execution
    embedded into them and maybe some additional functions (to be
    determined later). This should remove the special case of
    interceptors and would allow for greater flexibility of execution
    contexts and execution facilities.

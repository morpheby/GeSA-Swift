## Current state

There is a basic version implemented in Swift â€”
[MicroGene](https://github.com/morpheby/MicroGene). It lacks some of the
advertised features, but it provides the necessary foundation to implement
software based on Genetic System Architecture. And, most importantly, I use it
to develop fully-featured GeSA right now.

Also, it would be awesome to have later:

* GeSA-based language
* GeSA compartment and data ACLs with Gene trust features
* GeSA bindings or reimplementations for other languages
* Better matching algorithms
* Fully-featured MBEs (probably as part of the language)
* Gene-packs as libraries
* GeSA debugger
* GeSA IDE with data visualization and Gene overview
* GeSA-based OS with apps as Gene-packs
* Hardware-based gene-packs

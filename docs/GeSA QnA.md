## Sort of Q\&A

> *This looks weird*

It is\! Most programming paradigms are weird, till you become familiar
with them. I also felt weird at first, but now I feel all the time I
program not in GeSA, “this would look so much better in GeSA”.

> *This looks complex*

It is\! But also consider how it simplifies further additions and
complications.

> *This looks like it will be terribly slow*

Help me create a compiled language for GeSA. Compiling MBEs would help a
lot with the speed, and optimizations should even remove most of the
matching runtime that is unnecessary. Compiling genetic application will
certainly speed this up and still leave it a great paradigm.

See Comparison. And if it’s something not there, I would love to hear
about it — tell me at <ilya.mikhaltsou@gmail.com>

> *Why is it written in Swift?*

Swift is a modern and developing language, that has a lot of features
that are demanded by modern software development and lacking from other
languages.

I would love to base GeSA compiled language on Swift, and so, even
though at times Swift obstructs proper development by lacking some
important features (e.g. proper generics), I choose it.

Besides, GeSA needs not to be constrained to any single language.
Cross-computing can also facilitate communication between different
languages, and it shouldn’t be hard to port GeSA to any other OOP
language. Scala and C++ would be my next choice. Feel free to port if
you think it’s so great :)
